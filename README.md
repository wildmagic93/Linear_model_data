Hi,

in this repository i added a python code on a txt file called linear_model_data.txt where i build up a linar regression model by sklearn library from csv data obtained from an algorithm used to evalueate the maximum value of global horizonatl irradiance on floating solar panels inclined by a determined titl angle; the model used a combination of title angle and month period as input variables to evaluate the maximum GHI but it performed poorly maybe due to an incorrect definition of the input variable.
